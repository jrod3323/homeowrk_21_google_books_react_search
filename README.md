## Description 

This application is designed to provide a user with the ability to search the Google Books API to find books that they are interested in. The application is built using React.js which makes it a dynamic experience for the user.  They will be able to search for books as well as save books to their own list.  Once the book is read by the user, they have the ability to delete the book from their list as well.
